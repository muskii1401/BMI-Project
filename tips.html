              <h2>Tips for underweight people</h2>
              <p>Here are some healthy ways to gain weight when you're underweight:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span>Eat more frequently.</span> When you're underweight, you may feel full faster. Eat five to six smaller meals during the day rather than two or three large meals.</li>
                <li><span>Choose nutrient-rich foods.</span> As part of an overall healthy diet, choose whole-grain breads, pastas and cereals; fruits and vegetables; dairy products; lean protein sources; and nuts and seeds.</li>
                <li><span>Try smoothies and shakes.</span> Don't fill up on diet soda, coffee and other drinks with few calories and little nutritional value. Instead, drink smoothies or healthy shakes made with milk and fresh or frozen fruit, and sprinkle in some ground flaxseed. In some cases, a liquid meal replacement may be recommended.</li>
                <li><span>Watch when you drink.</span> Some people find that drinking fluids before meals blunts their appetite. In that case, it may be better to sip higher calorie beverages along with a meal or snack. For others, drinking 30 minutes after a meal, not with it, may work.</li>
                <li><span>Make every bite count.</span> Snack on nuts, peanut butter, cheese, dried fruits and avocados. Have a bedtime snack, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or a wrap sandwich with avocado, sliced vegetables, and lean meat or cheese.</li>
                <li><span>Top it off.</span> Add extras to your dishes for more calories — such as cheese in casseroles and scrambled eggs, and fat-free dried milk in soups and stews.</li>
                <li><span>Have an occasional treat.</span> Even when you're underweight, be mindful of excess sugar and fat. An occasional slice of pie with ice cream is OK. But most treats should be healthy and provide nutrients in addition to calories. Bran muffins, yogurt and granola bars are good choices.</li>
                <li><span>Exercise.</span> Exercise, especially strength training, can help you gain weight by building up your muscles. Exercise may also stimulate your appetite.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Tips for overweight people</h2>
              <p>Here are some healthy ways to loose weight when you are over weight:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span>Drinking water. </span> Drinking Water can boost metabolism by 24–30% over a period of 1–1.5 hours, helping you burn off a few more calories.</li>
                <li><span>Eating eggs. </span>Eating whole eggs can have all sorts of benefits, including helping you lose weight.Studies show that replacing a grain-based breakfast with eggs can help you eat fewer calories for the next 36 hours as well as lose more weight and body fat.If you don’t eat eggs, that's fine. Any source of quality protein for breakfast should do the trick.</li>
                <li><span>Drink green tea. </span>Like coffee, green tea also has many benefits, one of them being weight loss.Though green tea contains small amounts of caffeine, it is loaded with powerful antioxidants called catechins, which are believed to work synergistically with caffeine to enhance fat burning.Although the evidence is mixed, many studies show that green tea (either as a beverage or a green tea extract supplement) can help you lose weight. Green tea is available at most pharmacies, health stores, and grocery stores, as well as online.</li>
               <li><span>Cut back on added sugar. </span> Added sugar is one of the worst ingredients in the modern diet. Most people consume way too much. Studies show that sugar (and high-fructose corn syrup) consumption is strongly associated with an increased risk of obesity, as well as conditions including type 2 diabetes and heart disease.If you want to lose weight, cut back on added sugar. Just make sure to read labels, because even so-called health foods can be loaded with sugar</li>
               <li><span>Keep healthy food around in case you feel hungry. </span>Keeping healthy food nearby can help prevent you from eating something unhealthy if you become excessively hungry.Snacks that are easily portable and simple to prepare include whole fruits, nuts, baby carrots, yogurt and hard-boiled eggs.</li>
              <li><span>Eat more fiber. </span> Fiber is often recommended for weight loss. Although the evidence is mixed, some studies show that fiber (especially viscous fiber) can increase satiety and help you control your weight over the long term </li>
